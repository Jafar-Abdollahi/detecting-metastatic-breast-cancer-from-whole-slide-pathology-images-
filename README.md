In cancer patients, the main event resulting in death is metastasis. Being time-consuming and labor-intensive, traditional diagnosis approaches utilized for lymph node metastases, a.k.a. LNMets, are not fairly effective. Consequently, diagnostic complexes based upon deep learning (DL) algorithms have turned into a hot trend. The purpose of this study is to design, develop, and evaluate a deep learning system being able to detect metastases related to the lymph node. 

We have used a variety of techniques for automated IHC scoring, including handmade features and deep learning-based algorithms. We frequently perform a pre-processing phase to choose possible tissue regions for training the underlying model. Next, we sample small patches of the selected tissue regions, either randomly or using a sliding window approach.
Using FISH and IHC pictures, Yaziji et al. (2004) suggested a parallel tissue-based method for assessing gene status [9]. Brian D. Lehmann et al. (2011) used gene expression data for cluster analysis to identify triple-negative breast cancer subtypes [10]. In order to categorize breast cancer subgroups, Sorlie et al. (2001) built a gene expression pattern based on hierarchical clustering [11]. Even though each type of omics data provides a list of disease distinctions, correlation analysis is the only way to fully understand one type of omics data, which mostly reflects the reaction process rather than the causation process. We expect the combination of multi-omics data to enhance our comprehension of cross-molecular biological processes and deepen our understanding of the biological systems under study [12].
Lowery and his colleagues [13] used artificial neural networks to find miRNA signatures that were biologically important for ER, PR, and HER2 status. Furthermore, studies have demonstrated that supervised learning techniques yield more reliable results for variable class prediction in data sets than unsupervised methods [14]. Grimm et al. [15] established a connection between texture characteristics on DCE images and luminal subtypes of breast cancer. Agner et al. [16] found TN carcinoma using an SVM classifier and data from early post-contrast pictures of the whole tumor's shape and texture. For subtype separation, a number of studies have proposed employing textural or histogram data taken from DWI [17, 18]. Nevertheless, no research has looked at the classification of breast cancer subtypes utilizing texture analysis-based radiomics integrating DWI and DCE imaging. 
Based on miRNA expression, Hua et al. [19] suggested a dysregulated network of miRNA-mRNA to find different types of breast cancer. Xu et al. [20] did another study that used gene regulatory networks called miRNA-TF-mRNA to find out how different molecules interact with each other. Machine learning and deep learning [21] have also shown a lot of promise in the medical field. Medical imaging and healthcare analysis applications include whole-slide pathology [22], X-ray imaging [23], diabetes [24, 25], breast cancer [8], heart disease diagnosis [26], infectious diseases [27], medicinal plants [28], lung [47], and stroke [29].

<h2> Methods </h2>
The authors of this work created two cancer classification models using a variety of supervised deep learning approaches. The study's goal is to analyze the efficacy of several methods for detecting breast cancer and choose the most effective strategy. For this, we use the pre-trained VGG19 and Mobile Net models. The following subsections go into greater detail on each of the four models created for this study.

<h2> Conlusion </h2>
This study presents a deep learning model for whole-slide image-based breast cancer screening. Accurate and timely diagnosis is critical for both successful treatment and keeping cancer patients apart to prevent metastases. VGG19+CNN and MobileNet were two of the four deep learning architectures evaluated using datasets collected from various sources. As shown by its 98.05% accuracy, 98.05% recall, 98.43% precision, 99.5% specificity, 99.3% negative predictive value, 98.24% F1 score, 97.7% MCC, and 99.66% AUC, the VGG19+CNN model does a better job than previous models based on pathology image cancer. Future work will include growing the dataset, training epochs, and exploring different deep learning techniques like GAN for augmentation and classification in order to further improve the model's performance.
